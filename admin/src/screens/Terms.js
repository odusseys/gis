      </p>

      <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>

      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years of age to use this Mobile Application. By
        using this Mobile Application and by agreeing to this Agreement you
        warrant and represent that you are at least 18 years of age. If you
        create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible
        for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions
        taken in connection with it. Providing false contact information of any
        kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
        notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches
        of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
        including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
        omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part
        thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this
        Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our
        reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
        reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your
        email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further
        registration.
      </p>

      <h2>User content</h2>

      <p>
        We do not own any data, information or material (&quot;Content&quot;)
        that you submit in the Mobile Application in the course of using the
        Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
        integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual
        property ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but
        have no obligation to, monitor Content in the Mobile Application
        submitted or created using our Services by you. Unless specifically
        permitted by you, your use of the Mobile Application does not grant us
        the license to use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the
        Content created by you or stored in your user account for commercial,
        marketing or any similar purpose. But you grant us permission to access,
        copy, distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the
        Content of your user account solely as required for the purpose of
        providing the Services to you. Without limiting any of those
        representations or warranties, we have the right, though not the
        obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or remove any Content
        that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our policies or is in
        any way harmful or objectionable.
      </p>

      <h2>Adult content</h2>

      <p>
        Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content
        available in the Mobile Application. Where there is mature or adult
        content, individuals who are less than 18 years of age or are not
        permitted to access such content under the laws of any applicable
        jurisdiction may not access such content. If we learn that anyone under
        the age of 18 seeks to conduct a transaction through the Services, we
        will require verified parental consent, in accordance with the
        Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (&quot;COPPA&quot;).
        Certain areas of the Mobile Application may not be available to children
        under 18 under any circumstances.

      <h2>Backups</h2>

      <p>
        We are not responsible for Content residing in the Mobile Application.
        In no event shall we be held liable for any loss of any Content. It is
        your sole responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of your Content.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain
        circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able to restore
        some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and
        time when we may have backed up data for our own purposes. We make no
        guarantee that the data you need will be available.

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>

      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
        Mobile Application Developer, its affiliates, officers, directors,
        employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for

        however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without

      <h2>Severability</h2>

      <p>
